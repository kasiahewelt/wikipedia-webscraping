## Wikipedia company description harvesting 

 

1. Further investigate whether it is possible to get the data from the side panel from a company Wikipedia site

2. Get a list of companies <different contact - romance.sharma@bain.com> 

Kasia to reach out to DataQuality team, asking to get a list of aprox 1000 company names without description (krishankumar.choudhary@bain.com) 

-Ask for a fair distribution of company sizes for which we don’t have description 

-Ask to get these names together with their industry and rev bands 

3. Company name cleaning (https://pypi.org/project/cleanco/) 

4. Figure out how to best utilize “categories” to drill down to only finding companies (and not other random stuff)

Harvesting of cleaned company names from Wikipedia 

5. Set up timer, that captures how many ms go into capturing the info of each company 

6. Setup a report that shows description harvesting penetration 

- Report should show for combinations of rev bands x industry the raw number of company names given by DQ, and also the number of those companies for which we found company descriptions on wikipedia  

7. Matching (https://pypi.org/project/company-name-matching/)
